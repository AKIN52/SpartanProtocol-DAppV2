# Getting Started with Spartan Protocol DAppV2

All you need to do to get started:
- Copy repo URL into your Github Desktop or CLI and clone to local
- (Before first 'start') Run 'yarn' in the project directory to get all deps loaded
- Browse the issues list for an issue you want to work on, assign it to yourself (reach out if you want advice or permissions)
- Create a new branch with the Github Issue ID in it and some sort of a short descriptor of your choosing. i.e. "Fix-Home-Button-#435"
- Then run 'yarn start' in the project directory and a localhost window will pop up
- Go ahead and code! 
- Once you are done and have your commits completed, go ahead and make a merge request or ask someone to review the code in your branch
- Ready to contribute? Reach out in the community telegram to get connected with an online contributor who will put you through to the contributors channel
- Any and all skill levels welcome!
